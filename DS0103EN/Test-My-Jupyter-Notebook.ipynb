I always curious about the data and always involved every year to upgrade the data processing system in order to be better.*\n- *I continue my interest in data by became a leader in several organizations when I was in college, and it was so fun for me and the system I made is sustainable until now.*\n- *I have been asked as IT Consultant to Indihiang Health Clinic, the Tasikmalaya Department of Health subsidiary. My role here is to solve the problem of recording drugs and patients\u2019 data that have never been solved in 4 months. I designed the automatic data reporting system and result a system that can recapitulate data and generate every day accurately.*\n- *I also implemented the systems in at least 100 student organizations and sucessfully fasten their data processing.*\n\n*Then now I realize that I was involved in Data Science a long time ago, and I truly enjoy it.*\n\n---"
